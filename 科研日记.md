two projects():

1. the stability of compressible flow with GCP flows. I need find boundary condition in GATT_DNS to modify it from cavity to normal plate boundary(first).then verify photos,chart,table and data in docter thesis.

2. channel flow but with special boundary conditions: normal entry and exit(no velosity), but middle walls(up and down) will move(with same directions or inversely). some non-dimensional parameters: the rate of speed($U_{wall}/U_{\infty} $); characteristc length and the length of moveable wall; characteristc length and the distance from entry to the start of moveable wall.
