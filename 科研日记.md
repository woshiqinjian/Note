When we meet $\delta(x)$ in differentation and intergation, skip it and refer to books.

two projects Cheng Wan gives to me:

1. the stability of compressible flow with GCP flows. I need find boundary condition in **GATT_DNS** to modify it from cavity to normal plate boundary(first).then verify photos,chart,table and data in docter thesis.

2. channel flow but with special boundary conditions: **normal entry and exit(no velosity), but middle walls(up and down) will move(with same directions or inversely)**. Some non-dimensional parameters: the rate of speed($U_{wall}/U_{\infty} $); characteristc length and the length of moveable wall; characteristc length and the distance from entry to the start of moveable wall. Use **OPENSBLI** to do it.

GATT_DNS:

1. test a few cases: blasius + cavity, uniform + cavity and poiseuille flow.There is a example cases about poiseuille flow and it even contains moving boundary condition setting.Maybe I can start from that files to make GCP codes. Present tasks: 1. make it clear about which file controls mesh.type, write a note about this. 2. install matlab and configure the environment for GATT_DNS on port 52 server.

2. about matrixes discribeing flows, we used to let x-axis shoot from left to right and y-axis shoot form down to up. **BUT**, in code, we used to ***let x-axis shoot from up to down and y-axis shoot from left to right.*** It is very important!
